"""
NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
-------------------------------------
Language: Python

Problem Statement:
Create a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number 
between a given range (say 1 to 100), and the player tries to guess it.

After each guess, the program tells the player whether their guess was too high, 
too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the number.

-------------------------------------
FEATURES:
1. Random number generation using the 'random' module.
2. Looping until the player guesses correctly.
3. Feedback on each guess (too high / too low).
4. Keeps track of the number of attempts.
5. Option to play again after one round.

-------------------------------------
TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Each guess is O(1) operation.
- In the worst case, if the number range is N and you guess sequentially, 
  the complexity is O(N).
- Average case (binary-like guessing strategy) â‰ˆ O(log N).

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- O(1), since we only use a few variables.
